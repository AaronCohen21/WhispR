This is a lightweight Java chat app that I made for fun because I got really bored one day,
and I needed to find a way to talk to my friends in other classes without pulling out my phone.
The chat rooms run locally, so as long as everyone is connected to the same
Wi-Fi network you'll be able to talk.
